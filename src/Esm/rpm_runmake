## runmake
## -----------
## Perform a full build
##
## Usage:
##	rpm_runmake [-V 'module_version'] [-B 'build_config'] [-n]
##			or
##	rpm_runmake [-V 'module_version'] -r [-B 'build_config'] [-C] [-n]
##
## Arguments:
##	-B build_config	release type to build, (debug/release). default is release
##	-r 		rerun the build in place without doing a new checkout/tag
##	-C		don't clobber prior to the rerun
##	-n		No build.  Useful for checking build machine
##	-V module_version The MODULEVERSION define.
##
## In addition, the following environment variables are expected to be set:
##	RELEASE_TAG, BRANCH_TAG, BUILD_TARGET, PRODUCT, RELEASE_HOME, BUILD_CONFIG 
##	The target command is expected to have already been run to set up the
##	environment for the specified target
##
##	re-run can be used for 2 situations:
##	1. re-run a failed build to correct incorrect weeklybuild arguments
##		or other non-source code related problems (out of disk space)
##	2. re-run a build for a different BUILD_TARGET_OS_VERSION while using the same
##		source code image/tag
##	If the source code needs to be corrected, a full weeklybuild should be run
##	after the correction such that the code is properly tagged.
##
##	Since weeklybuild and target commands always set BUILD_CONFIG, this
##	script ignores BUILD_CONFIG.  As such the BuildOptions file
##	or the -B argument completely control BUILD_CONFIG for this product.
